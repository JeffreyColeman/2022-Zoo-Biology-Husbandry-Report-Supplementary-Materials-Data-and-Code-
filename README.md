# 2022-Zoo-Biology-Husbandry-Report-Supplementary-Materials-Data-and-Code-
Contained in this directory are supplementary materials for the 2022 Husbandry Report Coleman et al. in Zoo Biology. In addition to all microsatellite data and analytical output, some materials from an unpublished genomic/3RAD study, including an in silico digest/size selection of the publicly available downy woodpecker genome (this was done as a locus number estimate for the RADseq study, because woodpeckers are in the same order as toucans, though see research out of the Manthey lab at Texas Tech showing that woodpeckers have uniquely high TE content in their genomes) and the reads cleaned on the STACKS pipeline created by Julian Catchen and Nicolas Rochette (raw reads cannot be located), are included.
