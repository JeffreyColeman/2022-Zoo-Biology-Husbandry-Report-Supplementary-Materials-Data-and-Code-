# 2022-Zoo-Biology-Husbandry-Report-Supplementary-Materials-Data-and-Code-
Contained in this directory are supplementary materials for the 2022 Husbandry Report Coleman et al. in Zoo Biology. In addition to all microsatellite data and analytical output, material from unpublished genomic/3RAD study, including RAD reads from keel-billed toucans and analyses from Julian Catchen and colleagues' STACKS pipepline, as well as an in silico digest/size selection of the downy woodpecker genome (this was done as a locus number estimate for the RADseq study, because woodpeckers are in the same order as toucans, though see research out of the Manthey lab at Texas Tech showing that woodpeckers have uniquely high TE content in their genomes), are included.
