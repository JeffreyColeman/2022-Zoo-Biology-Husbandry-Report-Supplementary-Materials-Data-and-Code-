Contained in this directory are supplemental materials for Coleman et al. (2023) in Zoo Biology. In addition to all microsatellite data and analytical output, some materials from a genomic/3RAD study I led for several years but have not published, including an in silico digest/size selection of the publicly available downy woodpecker genome (this was done as a locus number estimate for the RADseq study, because woodpeckers are in the same order as toucans, and see a study out of the Manthey lab at Texas Tech [https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy105], which suggests that Piciformes [woodpeckers, honeyguides, toucans, and barbets] have uniquely high TE content in their genomes. The toucan species representative in the study was the Green-billed Toucan [Ramphastos dicolorus]) and the reads cleaned on the STACKS pipeline created by Julian Catchen and Nicolas Rochette (raw reads cannot be located), are included.
